How to use this project.

Requirements (check out the requirements.txt file):
Django - 3.2.2
mysqlclient - 2.0.3
psycopg2 - 2.8.6

Currently, the database used is a Postgresql server.
If you wish to try the project without a Postgresql server:
 - Comment out lines in base.py and development.py with DATABASES
 - Uncomment the default Sqlite DATABASE just above the postgres connection definition

Check out the env-sample.py file. This contains example variables that need to be set.
Copy this file as env.py file and provide variables corresponding to you local env.

There are three settings - base, development and production.
In your local env, set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to be either of these with:
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=covidapp.settings.development (in linux)
set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=covidapp.settings.development (in windows)

To set up the project:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
